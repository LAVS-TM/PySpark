PySpark project is an **analysis**, a development of **insights** and a training of a **prediction model** for different stocks dataset such as `APPLE`, `AMAZON` or `GOOGLE`.  

## Repository

The repository is organised as follows :

* `project_part1.ipynb` is our first part with the data analysis and with the insights of the stocks.
* `project_part2.ipynb` contains the part 2 of the project with the machine learning on the data.
* `data` contains the data of the project.
* `Big_Data_presentation.pdf` is our slides for the final presentation.


## Anaysis

First in this section, we **explore** the datasets to have more informations about them. We have 7 different dataset on the stocks of different companies : `AMAZON`, `APPLE`, `FACEBOOK`, `GOOGLE`, `MICROSOFT`, `TESLA` and `ZOOM`.

Then we study the datasets to answer those questions :
* What is the average of the **opening** and **closing prices** for each stock price and for different time periods (week, month, year) ?
* How do the stock prices change day to day and month to month ?
* Based on the opening and closing price, what is the **daily return** of each stock ?
* What are the stocks with the highest **daily return** ?
* What is the average **daily return** for different periods (week, month, and year) ?

We also analyse the **moving average** and the **return rate** of the stocks and the **correlation** between the different stocks.
